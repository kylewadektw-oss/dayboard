# User Role System Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status
âœ… **Complete**: User role types and permission system  
âœ… **Complete**: Database migration schema  
âœ… **Complete**: Permission utility functions

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
To activate the full user role system, run the migration:

```bash
# Apply the migration to your Supabase database
supabase db push
```

Or run it manually in your Supabase SQL editor:
- Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250905000001_user_roles_system.sql`
- Paste and execute in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor

### 2. Update Supabase Types
After running the migration, regenerate your types:

```bash
# Generate new types after migration
supabase gen types typescript --local > types_db.ts
```

### 3. Test the Role System
1. **Sign up/Sign in**: Create or use an existing account
2. **Check Dashboard**: You'll see your role (currently defaults to `super_admin` for development)
3. **Navigation**: Family-focused navigation replaces template marketing links
4. **Permissions**: Access control is active but using mock data until migration
