-- Fix for Security Definer View Warning
-- This addresses the security warning for view 'public.v_calendar_feed'
-- SECURITY DEFINER views can bypass RLS policies and pose security risks

-- The view now uses SECURITY INVOKER (default) which means:
-- 1. It respects the RLS policies of the querying user
-- 2. Users can only see calendar events from their own household
-- 3. The underlying table RLS policies automatically apply

COMMIT;

-- After running this script:
-- 1. The security warning should be resolved
-- 2. The view will properly respect RLS policies
-- 3. Application functionality should remain unchanged
-- 4. Users will only see events from their authorized households
