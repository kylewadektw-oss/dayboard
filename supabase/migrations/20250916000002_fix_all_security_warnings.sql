-- Migration: Fix all security warnings comprehensively
-- BentLo Labs LLC - Dayboardâ„¢
-- Date: September 16, 2025
-- Purpose: Fix security definer view and enable RLS on existing tables

BEGIN;

-- 1. Fix the security definer view issue
-- Drop and recreate the v_calendar_feed view without SECURITY DEFINER
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_calendar_feed;

-- First, let's create a simple view that only includes manual events
-- This avoids any issues with missing tables or columns
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_calendar_feed AS
  -- Manual events only (safest approach)
  SELECT
    'manual'::entity_kind    AS kind,
    e.id::text               AS event_id,
    e.household_id,
    e.title,
    e.description,
    e.location,
    e.start_ts,
    e.end_ts,
    e.all_day,
    e.color,
    null::text               AS link_href,
    jsonb_build_object('source','manual') AS meta
  FROM calendar_events e
  WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles pr 
    WHERE pr.user_id = auth.uid() AND pr.household_id = e.household_id
  )
;

-- 2. Enable RLS on existing tables if not already enabled
-- Check and enable RLS on lists table
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT (SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'lists' AND schemaname = 'public') IS NULL THEN

-- Comment explaining the security fixes
COMMENT ON VIEW v_calendar_feed IS 'Calendar feed view with SECURITY INVOKER (safe) - respects RLS policies of querying user. Fixed from SECURITY DEFINER to prevent privilege escalation. Compatible with existing table schemas.';
