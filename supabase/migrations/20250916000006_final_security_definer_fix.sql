-- Migration: Final fix for security definer view
-- BentLo Labs LLC - Dayboardâ„¢
-- Date: September 16, 2025
-- Purpose: Explicitly remove SECURITY DEFINER from v_calendar_feed view

BEGIN;

-- Drop the view completely to ensure clean slate
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.v_calendar_feed CASCADE;

-- Recreate with explicit SECURITY INVOKER (not DEFINER)
-- This is the safest approach to ensure no SECURITY DEFINER property
