## What's Ready for Deployment:

1. **Run the migration**: 
   ```sql
   -- Execute the contents of supabase/migrations/20250910000003_add_recipes_table.sql in Supabase
   ```

2. **All components are now using**:
   - ✅ Proper TypeScript types
   - ✅ Supabase integration (with fallback mock data until tables exist)
   - ✅ Real-time data updates
   - ✅ Household-based data filtering
   - ✅ User authentication integration

3. **The system includes**:
   - ✅ Recipe library with search
   - ✅ Favorite recipes management  
   - ✅ Weekly meal planning
   - ✅ Add recipes to meal plan modal
   - ✅ Recipe rating and review system
   - ✅ Cooking history tracking
   - ✅ Recipe collections/categories

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy Database Migration**: Execute the SQL migration in Supabase to create all recipe tables
2. **Test with Real Data**: Once tables exist, the components will automatically switch from mock data to real Supabase data
3. **Add Recipe Creation**: Consider adding a "Create New Recipe" form component
4. **Grocery List Generation**: The foundation is ready for automated grocery list creation from meal plans
