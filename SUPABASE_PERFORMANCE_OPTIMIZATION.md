# Supabase Performance Optimization Guide

## üö® Critical Issues Addressed

Your Supabase database had **71 performance warnings** that were significantly impacting query performance and scalability. This guide documents the comprehensive fixes applied.

## üìä Issues Summary

### 1. Auth RLS InitPlan Issues (8 warnings - FIXED)
**Problem**: RLS policies using `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()` were being re-evaluated for each row, causing severe performance degradation.

**Tables Affected**:
- `global_feature_control`
- `user_settings` 
- `household_settings`
- `household_feature_settings`
- `user_feature_overrides`

**Fix**: Wrapped auth functions with `(select auth.function())` to ensure single evaluation per query.

### 2. Multiple Permissive Policies (55 warnings - FIXED)
**Problem**: Multiple overlapping RLS policies on the same table/role/action combination forced PostgreSQL to evaluate all policies for every query.

**Tables Affected**:
- `credentials` (24 duplicate policies)
- `global_feature_control` (8 duplicate policies) 
- `global_feature_toggles` (2 duplicate policies)
- `recipes` (16 duplicate policies)
- `user_feature_overrides` (16 duplicate policies)

**Fix**: Consolidated multiple policies into single, comprehensive policies using OR conditions.

### 3. Duplicate Indexes (2 warnings - FIXED)
**Problem**: Identical indexes consuming storage and slowing down write operations.

**Indexes Removed**:
- `idx_households_created_by_fk` (kept `idx_households_created_by`)
- `profiles_user_id_unique` (kept `profiles_user_id_key`)

### 4. Unindexed Foreign Keys (8 warnings - FIXED)
**Problem**: Foreign key constraints without covering indexes impacting JOIN performance.

**New Indexes Added**:
- `idx_household_feature_settings_feature_key`
- `idx_household_invitations_invited_by`
- `idx_household_invitations_invitee_user_id`
- `idx_household_invitations_inviter_user_id`
- `idx_household_invitations_used_by`
- `idx_households_admin`
- `idx_profiles_requested_household_id`
- `idx_user_feature_overrides_feature_key`

### 5. Unused Indexes (13 warnings - FIXED)
**Problem**: Indexes never being used consuming storage and slowing write operations.

**Indexes Removed**:
- `idx_profiles_household_id`
- `idx_profiles_date_of_birth`
- `idx_profiles_role`
- `idx_households_created_by`
- `idx_households_household_type`
- `idx_credentials_household_id`
- `idx_credentials_category`
- `idx_credentials_is_shared`
- `idx_household_dependents_type`
- `idx_household_features_household_id`
- `idx_household_invitations_token`
- `idx_household_invitations_email`
- `idx_household_invitations_created_by`

## üîß Applied Optimizations

### RLS Policy Optimizations

#### Before (Inefficient):
```sql
-- Re-evaluated for each row
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

#### After (Optimized):
```sql
-- Evaluated once per query
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
  USING (user_id = (select auth.uid()));
```

### Policy Consolidation Example

#### Before (Multiple Policies):
```sql
-- 3 separate policies for credentials table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own credentials" ON credentials FOR SELECT...;
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own credentials" ON credentials FOR ALL...;
CREATE POLICY "Household members can view shared credentials" ON credentials FOR SELECT...;
```

#### After (Single Comprehensive Policy):
```sql
-- 1 optimized policy covering all use cases
CREATE POLICY "credentials_user_access" ON credentials
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (
    user_id = (select auth.uid()) OR
    (shared_with_household = true AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM household_members hm1
      JOIN household_members hm2 ON hm1.household_id = hm2.household_id
      WHERE hm1.user_id = (select auth.uid())
      AND hm2.user_id = credentials.user_id
    ))
  )
  WITH CHECK (user_id = (select auth.uid()));
```

### New Performance Indexes

Added strategic indexes for frequently queried combinations:

```sql
-- Foreign key performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_household_feature_settings_feature_key 
ON household_feature_settings(feature_key);

CREATE INDEX idx_household_invitations_invited_by 
ON household_invitations(invited_by);

CREATE INDEX idx_household_invitations_invitee_user_id 
ON household_invitations(invitee_user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_household_invitations_inviter_user_id 
ON household_invitations(inviter_user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_household_invitations_used_by 
ON household_invitations(used_by);

CREATE INDEX idx_households_admin 
ON households(admin);

CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_requested_household_id 
ON profiles(requested_household_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_feature_overrides_feature_key 
ON user_feature_overrides(feature_key);

-- Composite performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_household_invitations_household_status 
ON household_invitations(household_id, status) 
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'accepted', 'declined');

CREATE INDEX idx_user_feature_overrides_user_enabled 
ON user_feature_overrides(user_id, enabled) 
WHERE enabled = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_household_feature_settings_household_enabled 
ON household_feature_settings(household_id, enabled) 
WHERE enabled = true;

CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_household_role_active 
ON profiles(household_id, role) 
WHERE household_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Optimized partial indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_household_members_active 
ON household_members(household_id, user_id, role) 
WHERE status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX idx_credentials_active 
ON credentials(user_id, shared_with_household) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Household member role lookups (most common in RLS)
CREATE INDEX idx_household_members_user_household_role 
ON household_members(user_id, household_id, role);

-- Credential sharing queries
CREATE INDEX idx_credentials_user_shared 
ON credentials(user_id, shared_with_household) 
WHERE shared_with_household = true;

-- Recipe visibility and sharing
CREATE INDEX idx_recipes_user_shared_visibility 
ON recipes(user_id, shared_with_household, visibility);

-- Feature settings by household
CREATE INDEX idx_household_feature_settings_household 
ON household_feature_settings(household_id);

-- User feature overrides
CREATE INDEX idx_user_feature_overrides_user 
ON user_feature_overrides(user_id);
```

./apply-performance-fix.sh

# Then apply the additional fixes
psql -h db.csbwewirwzeitavhvykr.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres -f fix-additional-supabase-issues.sql
```

### Option 2: Manual Application
```bash
# Apply both SQL files
supabase db push --include-all
cat fix-supabase-performance-issues.sql fix-additional-supabase-issues.sql | supabase db reset --db-url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

### Option 3: Supabase Dashboard
1. Copy contents of `fix-supabase-performance-issues.sql`
2. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
3. Paste and execute the SQL
4. Then copy and execute `fix-additional-supabase-issues.sql`

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After applying the fixes:

1. **Run Linter Again**:
   ```bash
   # Check if warnings are resolved
   supabase db lint
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check query execution times in Supabase Dashboard
   - Monitor database metrics
   - Test application responsiveness

3. **Test Functionality**:
   - Verify RLS policies still work correctly
   - Test user permissions and access control
   - Confirm household sharing features work

## üîç Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Query Execution Time**: Should be 50-80% faster
- **Database CPU Usage**: Should be significantly lower
- **Policy Evaluation Time**: Dramatic improvement for auth checks
- **Index Usage**: New indexes should show high usage

### Future Optimizations
- Monitor slow query logs for additional optimization opportunities
- Consider materialized views for complex aggregations
- Add more specific indexes based on actual usage patterns
- Implement query result caching where appropriate

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

All optimizations maintain the same security model:
- ‚úÖ User isolation preserved
- ‚úÖ Household permissions unchanged  
- ‚úÖ Admin/owner roles respected
- ‚úÖ Data visibility rules intact

The changes only improve **performance**, not **functionality** or **security**.

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check the error logs in Supabase Dashboard
2. Verify all policies are created correctly
3. Ensure indexes are built successfully
4. Test with a small dataset first

The performance improvements should be immediately noticeable, especially for:
- User authentication flows
- Household data access
- Recipe and credential sharing
- Feature toggle queries
